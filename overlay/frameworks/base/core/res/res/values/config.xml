         gone to sleep.  When the PowerManager is asked to go to sleep, it will instead
         try to start this dream if possible.  The dream should typically call startDozing()
         to put the display into a low power state and allow the application processor
         to be suspended.  When the dream ends, the system will go to sleep as usual.
         Specify the component name or an empty string if none.
         Note that doze dreams are not subject to the same start conditions as ordinary dreams.
         Doze dreams will run whenever the power manager is in a dozing state. -->

         This mode provides best compatibility for devices that expect the interactive
         state to be tied to the display state.
         When true, setInteractive(...) will be called independently of whether the display
         is being turned on or off.  This mode enables the power manager to reduce
         clocks and disable the touch controller while the display is on.
